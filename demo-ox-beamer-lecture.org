See also the information on modes in the [[https://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf][Beamer Userguide]].

** Text only in article mode :B_ignoreheading:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
:END:

Selecting the beamer property/tag =B_ignoreheading= using =org-beamer-select-environment=, enables to include text that should only appear in article mode. This is possible because the documentclass option =ignorenonframetext= is used for the presentation slides.
